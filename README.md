This is a small Library App. It is one of 'The Odin Project' projects.

The app allows you to add books to your library.

When you save a book to your library it is saved to localStorage on your browser.

Once a book is added to your library it is placed at the bottom.

You can sort by title, author, pages, read status, or you can reverse the order of your current sorting selection;
